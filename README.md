# Pacman
This is a pacman game i am currently working on for fun. 
## Installation
To try it out for now there is no installation or anything but you need npm and npm live-server.<br>Download the files and perform the command `live-server` inside the folder. Then navigate to /code/html/ to play.
## About the game
The code is written in such a way that it is easy to make another level even for someone that doesn't know how to write code. All that is needed for such are a .tmx, a .json (the one that is already contained) that can be produced with the use of the software 'Tiled' and the '/assets/sprites/tileset.png', and a json file in whitch there are (for now manually) written the points array and the starting axes of pacman.
